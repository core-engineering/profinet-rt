# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in `profinet-rt`.

## Development

```bash
cargo test                                   # unit + integration tests
cargo fmt --all                              # format (max_width = 100)
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings    # lint (warnings are errors)
```

All three must be clean before a PR.

## Guidelines

- **Pure Rust**, no bundled third-party C stack; no GPL/copyleft code.
- Wire-format code is validated **byte-exact** against real captures
  (see [`docs/dcp-golden-frames.md`](docs/dcp-golden-frames.md)); add a test vector
  with any new frame type.
- No IEC standard text copied into the repo — paraphrase only.
- Keep big-endian on the wire.
